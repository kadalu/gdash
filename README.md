# gdash - GlusterFS Dashboard

## Install

```
curl -LO https://github.com/kadalu/gdash/releases/download/v1.0.0/gdash
chmod +x ./gdash
sudo mv ./gdash /usr/local/bin/gdash
gdash --version
```

## Usage

Start `gdash` service in any one of the Gluster server node.

```
sudo gdash <HOSTNAME>
```

Provide the hostname to identify where gdash is running. Use the same hostname or IP which is used with Gluster Peer/Volume commands. Gdash will use this to replace the mention of "localhost" in the peer commands.

Protect the dashboard access from others by setting the username and password.

Generate One way hash of Password

```
$ echo -n "MySecret@01" | sha256sum
